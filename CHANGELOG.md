# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-11

Complete aesthetic upgrade of the existing campaign.

- Shared typography, materials, controls and responsive layouts throughout the title, camp, map, battles, political Contests, character, journal, ledger, settings, promotions and finale.
- Twenty-one original, locally bundled WebP illustrations: seven protagonist stages, seven character portraits, a title composition and six regional scenes. Asset provenance and generation instructions are documented.
- Clearer Canvas terrain, figures, faction markings and political chambers; bounded, reduced-motion-aware feedback that does not mutate game state.
- Deferred artwork caching, truthful offline progress, retry after interruption and revision-isolated service-worker updates. Both existing compressed size gates remain unchanged.
- Inline error feedback, predictable mobile control order, coalesced render bindings and protection against asynchronous reign-card races.
- Fifty tests pass; the legal route still completes twelve chapters and twenty-five encounters in 231 player turns. Core rules, campaign data and storage modules are byte-identical to 0.1.0. Detailed measurements and test limits appear in `docs/aesthetic-verification.md`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-11

Initial complete campaign implementation.

- Twelve chapters and twenty-five playable battle and Contest encounters, from recruit training to the imperial accession.
- Original Danube-to-Rome narrative, recurring cast, signalled character fates and replacement branches, consequential choices, historical source notes, and an epilogue that recalls the early campaign.
- Shared browser/Node tactical rules with legal actions and previews, autonomous allies, earned command capacity, formations, morale, and preparations.
- Grid-based political Contests with deadline voting, stance, Resolve, seven speech abilities, and recorded promises.
- Milestone-derived Senate and finale locks, provincial allocation and judgment, three campaign meters, a finale forecast, and playable confrontation routes with costly recovery backing.
- Code-drawn isometric mosaic battlefields, evolving portraits and insignia, fresco camp panels, responsive controls, keyboard targets, optional generated sound, and reduced-motion settings.
- Encounter snapshots, validated autosaves, mirrored browser storage, portable save codes, and an end-of-campaign reign card.
- Dependency-free native JavaScript modules, a static build and preview server, generated offline cache, web-app manifest and icons, and one configurable public site address.
- A Node rules test suite and legal-command campaign autoplay harness, kept separate from development-only scenario injection.

The target playtime and subjective quality require human playtesting. Live custom-domain publication, real iOS/Android installation, device share sheets, and long-term offline/save retention require owner-side deployment and physical-device checks. Verification results are reported separately from these implementation notes.
